                    I am a Software engineer with a passion for building functional and user-friendly web applications.
                    I studied software engineer at Moringa School, where I learned to work across the stack and gained hands-on experience with modern technologies.
                    Currently, I'm furthering my studies at PLP Academy, focusing on web development and Python.
                </p>
                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    My skillset spans both frontend and backend engineer, allowing me to contribute to various stages of the software engineer lifecycle.
                    I am eager to learn, grow, and collaborate with others to create impactful digital solutions.

                <p class="about-paragraph">
                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, working on personal projects, and connecting with fellow developers.
