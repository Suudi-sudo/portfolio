##  Overview

This is my personal developer portfolio built entirely using **pure HTML5 and CSS3**, with no frameworks or JavaScript libraries. It highlights my focus on clean code, responsive design, accessibility, and performance-first development.

## Features

-  100% Vanilla HTML & CSS — No frameworks, no JavaScript
-  Fully responsive and mobile-first layout
-  CSS-only interactivity (filters, animations, hover effects)
-  Semantic HTML structure with ARIA attributes
-  Optimized for fast loading and cross-browser compatibility
